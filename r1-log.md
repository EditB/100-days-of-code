# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Edit B.

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 30/12/17.

## Log

### R1D1 - 30/12/17
- Set up Tweet (I'm new to this) and tweeted that I'm in. I 2 min time someone already liked my tweet! How cool is this!
- Forked this 100-days-of-code and Figuring out how to edit a .md file. Again, new to this, but doing it is the best way to learn...
- Found some links on editing an .md file and on what is forking. Read up on both. Getting a bit more comfortable with this now!
- Joined the Slack channel for 100xCode
- Added my first LinkedIn post (about the 100 days challenge, coding and all); again, needed to figure out how to do it!

What a day it's been!! I've actually spent the whole day coding. Even skipped my kick-box class.
Finished the learnyoumongo set from free code camp. Lessons 3-9. The 3rd one was the hardest, but once I figured out how the basic script works the rest was more straightforward. Still had issues with the last one (exercise 9, the aggregation), but finished it today. It's 9.50pm (been coding pretty much since 6am). Quickly do the tweet and that's it. Did a good 12-13 hours mostly straight coding.

### R1D2 - 31/12/17
- Did about 3 hours today (8am till 11am)
- how-to-npm lessons 1-11 (playing with npm in AWS Cloud9)

### R1D3 - 1/1/18
- Did about 3 hours today (all over the place)
- how-to-npm lessons 12-16 (playing with npm in AWS Cloud9)

### R1D4 - 2/1/18
- Did about 2 hours today
- set up learnyounode on my laptop so that I don't have to waste AWS free tier hours
- Did lessons 1-4; some of this stuff I already had to figure out with learnyoumongo (+ had to do assynchronious calls with AJAX when did my fcc front end cert) so it went quite well.

### R1D5 - 3/1/18
- Did about 2 hours today 
- learn-you-node lessons 5-6
- Got stuck at lesson 6, trying to understand how to write node.js modules; still need to tweek the files as it's not working yet. 

### R1D6 - 4/1/18
- Really love this 100 days challenge!
- Got up early, did about 2 hours
- learn-you-node lessons 6-8
- Finished lesson 6 and wrote my first nodeJS module. Once figured out how to do a module, the next will be much easier. Just had to fiddle with the right setup with callbacks in both files. Now I understand that you can just write callback and don't need to do function()etc.
- It felt really easy to do 1 program files after the module, just solving one problem, require a module to help with it.

### R1D7 - 5/1/18
- I wish I had more time to just sit and do coding. But as it is school holidays, gotta go home to entertain the kids...
- Finished only 1 module (lesson8; started on lesson9 but it needs tweaking). Slept in today so could only do 1 hour.

### R1D8 - 6/1/18
- Finished lesson 9. Had a late night last night and a very hot (44 degree Celsius) day today so my brain was a bit slow. But still sat down and did some coding (an hour and half all up in 2-3 goes)

### R1D9 - 7/1/18
- Finished lesson 9, started at lesson 10, but got stock on how to call listener several times. How to check when to close connection...

### R1D10 - 8/1/18
- It's late and I'm tired but still finished lesson 10 and 11.

### R1D11 - 9/1/18
- Lesson 12: http UPPERCASER (Node JS)

### R1D12 - 10/1/18
- Lesson 13: But couldn't finish it; still trying to figure out how to go about it. Wrote some of the code but still need to do more resarch on how to send back JSON response to different "exit points" whatever they are...

### R1D13 - 11/1/18
- Finished lesson 13 and moved onto Express.JS! Yeah! Finished Lesson 1 & 2 (and installed expressworks on my laptop). Stuff Cloud 9!

### R1D14 - 12/1/18
- Finished Express.js lesson 3-5. Stuck on Lesson 6. Feel too tired to figure it out. But I still did a good hour plus. 

### R1D15 - 13/1/18
- Finished Express.js lesson 6. That's all I did today. Too busy to do more. Still, took me an hour to figure out lesson 6.

### R1D16 - 14/1/18
- Finished Express.js (lesson 7-8). Ready to start with backend API development projects, but first need to set up Glitch and GitHub.

### R1D17 - 15/1/18
- Set up Glitch and GitHub. Started to code on Glitch. Made a Hello World with current date in Jade (iso html). Setting up the computer as well for glitch/express/mongo nodejs. First will try the API on Glitch, then will probably give it a go on GitHub as well. 

### R1D18 - 16/1/18
- Playing with Glitch. Finally figured out how to get blah.com/asdfd (the part after the slash). Now need to find a way to turn a natural time stamp to a unix one (and find different ways to decipher natural language dates, like 2Jan2018 or January the second 2018)?? We shall see. 

### R1D19 - 17/1/18
- Still working on Glitch. Trying to figure out how to convert timestamps (unix to natural language and vica versa + null for everything else)

### R1D20 - 18/1/18
- The project on Glitch is pretty much done. Still want to test it a bit, clean up the code and back it up on GitHub. 

### R1D21 - 19/1/18
- Finished up Glitch (Timestamp Microservice). Had to figure out how to link css to index.jade, and finally solved it by adding app.use(express.static('public')); to server.js. Also downloaded the files to my computer and then added them to the GitHub repo as per fcc requirements.

### R1D22 - 20/1/18
- Finished up the second backend assignment: Request Header Parser Microservice. It was actually pretty straightforward, with only one file (server.js). I probably put a good 4 hours into it today. Had a great run!!! :-))

### R1D23 - 21/1/18
- Worked on the URL Shortener (started it yesterday). Also downloaded it to my computer and ran the code there (the initial project is on Glitch)

### R1D24 - 22/1/18
- Couldn't get much done today; added verification for the URL.

### R1D25 - 23/1/18
- Worked out the details for the rest of the project. Set up MongoDB on my local environment. Still need to set it up for Glitch.

### R1D26 - 24/1/18
- Not sure if this and the tweet days are in sync... Anyway, today couldn't get much done. Had a long and busy day and got really tired by the evening when I was meant to do the hour of coding. Still did it but couldn't get much done...

### R1D27 - 25/1/18
- Added the dates into this github doc as I had the feeling that I got out of whack with this numbering and the tweet numbering...
- Spent the whole day on the url shortening challenge; still working on localhost and was trying to do the mongo, but keep getting errors. Can't find(), can't insert(). Frustrating.

### R1D28 - 26/1/18
- Not much luck today. Still couldn't work the url validation out (trying the hard way, to see if a url is actually working). So ended up again reverting back to the older version. Probably will just stick with the minimum requirement of validating the url format (like starting with http/https and having a dot in it somewhere). And just do the simple, easy way. And once it's done, then we can do more fancy stuff.

### R1D29 - 27/1/18
- Reworked the whole code based on specifications. In other words, just stick with the requirements, keep it very simple, nothing fancy.
- Added new verification based on specs for the urls format
- Added insert for the /new/path 
- Checked the newly added records both in command line and in Mongo Compass. Mongo Compass was very useful because as it turned out, I did create 2 separate dbs, one through command line (urlshortener/urls) and one through Server.js (urls). So whatever I saved through the program didn't show up, and when I was looking for records via the program that I saved in the command line it again didn't show up. Now I know why. Had to modify server.js to point to localhost/urlshrotener/urls (instead of localhost/urls). Now it's working.
- Indeed, the tweets and this log was out of sync with the day numbers. Fixed it now...

### R1D30 - 28/1/18
- A very hot day today. Was hard to work and get things done It's getting late, the code is not working again, and feel too tired to figure out why. I've added more code to generate the shortURL and also to find longURL in the database. The output is not working for some reason (the saving does). It updates the output after the save but then somehow by hte end of hte code it reverts back to an error msg, not sure where it's comming from... Tried to put in console.log()s but still couldn't catch where the value of output changes...

### R1D31 - 29/1/18
- Finally got around the assync nature of Express.js/MongoDB combination for urlshortener; got the code working; still need to do more testing and very possibly a bit of code review if we can make it prettier. But for now it's a step ahead to get most of it working.

### R1D32 - 30/1/18
- Tested the code and found some issues; fixed the issues and implemented parts that weren't there; it's pretty much working now, but still need to change the shorturl generating logic.

### R1D33 - 31/1/18
- Finished the Server.js for URL Shortener. It's ready to be deployed to Glitch. Of course to do that will need to set up MongoDB as well (currently I've been using my local development environment - localhost etc). But I feel I did enough for today (about 2 hours) and I have other commitments so will just have to leave it there for now. Will deploy tomorrow. That's one of the things I've learnt this month (Jan): been way too focused on this project and everything else in my life just had to wait. It's time for a bit more balance, and need to make sure I sleep more so that I can last the distance. So here, I draw the line for 2 hours today. As tempting as it might be to just keep going and ignore everything else....

### R1D34 - 1/2/18
- Set up mlab, deployed the code to Glitch.
- Still found an issue, for the shortURL redirect logic. Will fix it tomorrow.
- Got to coding too late and since it's getting close to midnight, my brain is pretty slow right now.

### R1D35 - 2/2/18
- Managed to fit coding into my daytime; so much better than struggling to stay awake and focus near midnight...
- Fixed up the shortURL redirect issue in Glitch, and also did a code review and deleted what was not needed. The code is shorter and easier to read now.
- Figured out how to see the changes in GitHub (compared to the previous version). It's really exciting that all this is getting easy and natural now. Really, the more you practice the better you get... 

### R1D36 - 3/2/18
- Started on new project (Image Search); set up the basic things for it on Glitch; still need to find an image search API; tried about 3 so far (from node), but they all require you to sign up with Google first. I just want to find one with no pre-requisits. Will probably try a gif search and see how that goes. Spent most afternoon on coding on and off. Or more likely, reading up on requirements and doing searches for API. And just a bit of coding setting up the file and also figuring out how to do the nested JSON.

### R1D37 - 4/2/18
- Still working on the same project (Img search). Spent a lot of time trying to find an img search API where I don't need to register. Finally settled with a gif one (giphy). Still need to work through the loop to render it in a nested JSON format.

### R1D38 - 5/2/18
- Getting late again...; fixed the above issue, so the nested JSON renders fine.
- Also did some jobhunting and Joomla studies.

### R1D39 - 6/2/18
- Getting late again...
- Spent most of the morning on setting up Joomla and Wordpress on my laptop (with WampServer and MySQL)

### R1D40 - 7/2/18
- 40 days... Almost halfway through...
- Started to build a website for my portfolio on Glitch. Only had an hour today. Also had to make screenshots of the existing projects I did. Still going...

### R1D41 - 8/2/18
- Spent most of my day to get the navigation menu working on my Glitch portfolio. Finally managed to tweek the javascript to correctly highlight the menu items in use. Also started to do printscreens of my CodePen projects. Still not finished...

### R1D42 - 9/2/18
- Not much time for coding today. Spent my hour on Photoshop (taking screenshots of my projects and resizing them for my website). Did quite a few projects, which is nice. But a lot of pics to take and resize...

### R1D43 - 10/2/18
- Busy day, not much got done today. Trying to display my project pics in a grid format. Tried to do it with just HTML and CSS but might have to do it eventually with Bootstrap. Too tired now to make it work though. Should really try to code more during the daytime and just leave the evenings free.

### R1D44 - 11/2/18
- Another busy day. Weekend with the family and lots of things on. Hard to find time for coding.
- Read up on responsive web designs. Want to implement them on my website.
- Spent a lot of time trying to make my glitch code on localhost. Had to change a lot of paths for things to load (incl pictures, but also the javascript and css path and all the other pages' paths...). It's working now, but couldn't get started on implementing the breakpoints for responsive design.

### R1D45 - 12/2/18
- Finished the basic structure of the grid display for EBProjects. Using float, percentage and breakpoints. Seem to work ok. 

### R1D46 - 13/2/18
- Too tired to do much. Added some more text/pics to the website (my portfolio). Really need to rest up a bit.

### R1D47 - 14/2/18
- Still working on my website. Started to add descriptions to my projects. Still hasn't hooked up all the projects...

### R1D48 - 15/2/18
- Still working on the website. Added more photos/descriptions. And yes, still more to go.

### R1D49 - 16/2/18
- Almost halfway through. Watched a Selenium/Java tutorial. Should get back to it as well.
- Still building my website, started to hook up the glitch projects (the codepen part is pretty much done).

### R1D50 - 17/2/18
- Created pretty cool stick-it notes for the projects I've been doing. Looks good and was pretty easy based on the help that's on the web. Mainly CSS. Spent the whole day on it...

### R1D51 - 18/2/18
- Added some new photos/descriptions to my website. It's looking pretty good. Will deploy it to Glitch tomorrow.
- Also looked into creating a mobile app with Java. Want to re-create Giraffe so that it's cross-platform.

### R1D52 - 19/2/18
- Finished my Glitch EBportfolio webpage. Also uploaded the CodePen projects to GitHub. Should have done it when I was working on the projects, it's easier to keep track of versions. But now if I do a code review I can just check it in on top of it.

### R1D53 - 20/2/18
- Spent the whole day reading up on Java and Selenium
- Fired up Eclipse again. Planning to do Giraffe (my music teacher's app for iOS) in Java (so that it can be used on Android as well). But still need to read up on how to do mobile app on Eclipse with Java. Found a tutorial for it. Will do more tomorrow.

### R1D54 - 21/2/18
- Looks like forgot to update yesterday; was working again on imagesearch project (doing it on localhost; added in the data from the url - the search word and the offset - and get the gifs based on that)

### R1D55 - 22/2/18
- Still working on the imagesearch; started to add in MongoDB stuff (and had to refresh my memory on how to run mongodb locally). It's all back on track. Saving the search words+date is done, but still need to add the part that find the last 10 record and displays it. Something to do tomorrow...
Also, getting much more comfortable using the git command line. Initally I was just uploading the files manually, but now I can push from the command line. Also did a pull just to practice. It feels good how much more confidence I develop day by day. Reallly grateful for Kallaway to come up with this project.

### R1D56 - 23/2/18
- Started to implement the latest search part of the project. I was looking for ways to do it, but then finally just got back to my old mongo notes, and there it was. I should just spend a day writing up my notes properly and memorising them. Even if I spend several days on it it would be a really good investment of my time...

### R1D57 - 24/2/18
- Finished the image-search project. 

### R1D58 - 25/2/18
- Bought a domain name, set up hosting and a wordpress website. Busy day with the family.

## R1D59 - 26/2/18
- I was too tired to bother with the log yesterday. Still worked on the website (mywebportfolio.tech), trying to figure out the right size of picture to display correctly (as the resizing option doesn't seem to work). So ended up manually fidgeting with the pics for the main page display.

## R1D60 - 27/2/18
- Worked on mywebportfolio.tech. Fixed up the little displayed images for the projects on the front page (the wordpress logo took ages to resize so that it gets the folded up effect with the little circle it's in). But it's done. Also added the slide show for the Glitch project page. Now that it's all worked out, the rest should be easier to set up (i.e. the SlideShow for CodePen and WordPress.) But that's for tomorrow...

## R1D61 - 28/2/18
- Finished the first version of My Web Portfolio.tech. It's working and it looks ok. Perhaps tomorrow I can explore adding a subdomain and create a different WP website for a different look and feel to add to the project...

## R1D62 - 1/3/18
- Playing with Ruby on Rails today. The MVC structure is pretty similar to Laravel and also to Angular.js

## R1D63 - 2/3/18
- Ruby tutorial (tryruby.org) + Ruby on Rails 5 tutorial (about the framework) via Stackskills. 
 
## R1D64 - 3/3/18
- Still working through the Ruby on Rails tutorial. It's a pretty easy framework to use, and I've created a todoapp (I've already done a demo app previously). So now I'm gonna create a repository for it here and upload the first version (with a template home, about and help page).

## R1D65 - 4/3/18
- Continued with Ruby on Rails. Doing database work with sqlite (and Model).
- Also started to read up on Delphi. Might download an evaluation copy, we'll see.

- Added a HelloWorld project with Delphi

## R1D69 - 8/3/18
- Continued with Ruby on Rails app.
- Also went to a Laravel meetup to see how a Laravel app is "glued" together.

## R1D70 - 9/3/18

## R1D75 - 15/3/18
- Did more work on Rails blog

## R1D76 - 16/3/18

## R1D77 - 17/3/18
- AWS: Set up a serverless S3 bucket website - it was really easy;
- Also started with the EC2 example, but lots of things are different on my console, so had to change things. Didn't finish this one yet (although did set up the project, but haven't done the AWS CLI config and git credentials...)

## R1D78 - 18/3/18
- Ruby on Rails

## R1D79 - 19/3/18
- Did Ruby on Rails this morning. I think the tweets and this directory are out of whack again.... Anyway, just following the tweet day number. WIll try to go through the tweets and see where it went wrong. Anywya, don't mind doing an extra day of coding, it's fun!

## R1D80 - 20/3/18
- Ruby on Rails

## R1D81 - 21/3/18
- HTML, CSS, jQuery. Mainly reading code I've written and writing things out to memorize (like commonly used functions etc) so that I can then write it from scratch on a blank sheet should I need it for an interview...

## R1D82 - 22/3/18
- HTML CSS jQuery - reviewing Free Code Camp stuff

## R1D83 - 23/3/18
- Selenium with Java

## R1D84 - 24/3/18

## R1D85 - 25/3/18
- Delphi
- updated gemfile.lock in both of my ruby apps (loofah needed to be updated, but ran the bundle update on the whole lot)

## R1D86 - 26/3/18
- Trying to set up Kibana and Elastisearch; had to change a permission for a Babel file and now it works locally

## R1D87 - 27/3/18
- Trying to set up Kibana and Elastisearch via Docker; 

## R1D88-9 - 28-9/3/18
- Pretty much spent most of the time figuring out why Kibana and Elastisearch is not coming up with Docker - they were listed on docker as created containers, but not showing up on localhost. Finally found a doc about forwarding hosts on virtualbox and that really helped. So now it's working on docker. I did delete the local copy of elastisearch, but very likely won't need it anyway. Now that docker toolbox is set up, will just go with it.

## R1D90 - 30/3/18
- Pracising the Elastisearch1 material on Docker Kibana/Elastisearch

## R1D91 - 31/3/18

- Pracising the Elasticsearch
- Tried to deploy todo app to heroku but it keeps crashing.

## R1D93 - 2/4/18
- Pracising Elasticsearch
- Ruby on Rails (started my recipies project)

## R1D94 - 3/4/18
- Set up Heroku (I think it was yesterday or the day before) and deployed todoapp and blog app; before I managed to deploy I had to re-install my rails environment as nothing was working (since - following a heroku doc - installed jruby...). But re-installing rails fixed it and now I can bundle install again.
- Still working through Elastisearch2; if I try to start up the multi-node though it fails, but simple startup works. Not sure, but looks like based on the log that there's probably memory issues...
