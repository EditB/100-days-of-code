## Log

### R1D1 
- Set up Tweet (I'm new to this) and tweeted that I'm in. I 2 min time someone already liked my tweet! How cool is this!
- Forked this 100-days-of-code and Figuring out how to edit a .md file. Again, new to this, but doing it is the best way to learn...
- Found some links on editing an .md file and on what is forking. Read up on both. Getting a bit more comfortable with this now!
- Joined the Slack channel for 100xCode
- Added my first LinkedIn post (about the 100 days challenge, coding and all); again, needed to figure out how to do it!

What a day it's been!! I've actually spent the whole day coding. Even skipped my kick-box class.
Finished the learnyoumongo set from free code camp. Lessons 3-9. The 3rd one was the hardest, but once I figured out how the basic script works the rest was more straightforward. Still had issues with the last one (exercise 9, the aggregation), but finished it today. It's 9.50pm (been coding pretty much since 6am). Quickly do the tweet and that's it. Did a good 12-13 hours mostly straight coding.

### R1D2
- Did about 3 hours today (8am till 11am)
- how-to-npm lessons 1-11 (playing with npm in AWS Cloud9)

### R1D3
- Did about 3 hours today (all over the place)
- how-to-npm lessons 12-16 (playing with npm in AWS Cloud9)

### R1D4
- Did about 2 hours today
- set up learnyounode on my laptop so that I don't have to waste AWS free tier hours
- Did lessons 1-4; some of this stuff I already had to figure out with learnyoumongo (+ had to do assynchronious calls with AJAX when did my fcc front end cert) so it went quite well.

### R1D5
- Did about 2 hours today 
- learn-you-node lessons 5-6
- Got stuck at lesson 6, trying to understand how to write node.js modules; still need to tweek the files as it's not working yet. 

### R1D6
- Really love this 100 days challenge!
- Got up early, did about 2 hours
- learn-you-node lessons 6-8
- Finished lesson 6 and wrote my first nodeJS module. Once figured out how to do a module, the next will be much easier. Just had to fiddle with the right setup with callbacks in both files. Now I understand that you can just write callback and don't need to do function()etc.
- It felt really easy to do 1 program files after the module, just solving one problem, require a module to help with it.
