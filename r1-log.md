The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 30/12/17.

## Log

### R1D1 
- Set up Tweet (I'm new to this) and tweeted that I'm in. I 2 min time someone already liked my tweet! How cool is this!
- Forked this 100-days-of-code and Figuring out how to edit a .md file. Again, new to this, but doing it is the best way to learn...
- Found some links on editing an .md file and on what is forking. Read up on both. Getting a bit more comfortable with this now!
- Joined the Slack channel for 100xCode
- Added my first LinkedIn post (about the 100 days challenge, coding and all); again, needed to figure out how to do it!

What a day it's been!! I've actually spent the whole day coding. Even skipped my kick-box class.
Finished the learnyoumongo set from free code camp. Lessons 3-9. The 3rd one was the hardest, but once I figured out how the basic script works the rest was more straightforward. Still had issues with the last one (exercise 9, the aggregation), but finished it today. It's 9.50pm (been coding pretty much since 6am). Quickly do the tweet and that's it. Did a good 12-13 hours mostly straight coding.

### R1D2
- Did about 3 hours today (8am till 11am)
- how-to-npm lessons 1-11 (playing with npm in AWS Cloud9)

### R1D3
- Did about 3 hours today (all over the place)
- how-to-npm lessons 12-16 (playing with npm in AWS Cloud9)

### R1D4
- Did about 2 hours today
- set up learnyounode on my laptop so that I don't have to waste AWS free tier hours
- Did lessons 1-4; some of this stuff I already had to figure out with learnyoumongo (+ had to do assynchronious calls with AJAX when did my fcc front end cert) so it went quite well.

### R1D5
- Did about 2 hours today 
- learn-you-node lessons 5-6
- Got stuck at lesson 6, trying to understand how to write node.js modules; still need to tweek the files as it's not working yet. 

### R1D6
- Really love this 100 days challenge!
- Got up early, did about 2 hours
- learn-you-node lessons 6-8
- Finished lesson 6 and wrote my first nodeJS module. Once figured out how to do a module, the next will be much easier. Just had to fiddle with the right setup with callbacks in both files. Now I understand that you can just write callback and don't need to do function()etc.
- It felt really easy to do 1 program files after the module, just solving one problem, require a module to help with it.

### R1D7
- I wish I had more time to just sit and do coding. But as it is school holidays, gotta go home to entertain the kids...
- Finished only 1 module (lesson8; started on lesson9 but it needs tweaking). Slept in today so could only do 1 hour.

### R1D8
- Finished lesson 9. Had a late night last night and a very hot (44 degree) day today so my brain was a bit slow. But still sat down and did some coding (an hour and half all up in 2-3 goes)

### R1D9
- Finished lesson 9, started at lesson 10, but got stock on how to call listener several times. How to check when to close connection...

### R1D10
- It's late and I'm tired but still finished lesson 10 and 11.

### R1D11
- Lesson 12: http UPPERCASER (Node JS)

### R1D12
- Lesson 13: But couldn't finish it; still trying to figure out how to go about it. Wrote some of the code but still need to do more resarch on how to send back JSON response to different "exit points" whatever they are...

### R1D13
- Finished lesson 13 and moved onto Express.JS! Yeah! Finished Lesson 1 & 2 (and installed expressworks on my laptop). Stuff Cloud 9!

### R1D14
- Finished Express.js lesson 3-5. Stuck on Lesson 6. Feel too tired to figure it out. But I still did a good hour plus. 

### R1D15
- Finished Express.js lesson 6. That's all I did today. Too busy to do more. Still, took me an hour to figure out lesson 6.

### R1D16
- Finished Express.js (lesson 7-8). Ready to start with backend API development projects, but first need to set up Glitch and GitHub.

### R1D17
- Set up Glitch and GitHub. Started to code on Glitch. Made a Hello World with current date in Jade (iso html). Setting up the computer as well for glitch/express/mongo nodejs. First will try the API on Glitch, then will probably give it a go on GitHub as well. 

### R1D18
- Playing with Glitch. Finally figured out how to get blah.com/asdfd (the part after the slash). Now need to find a way to turn a natural time stamp to a unix one (and find different ways to decipher natural language dates, like 2Jan2018 or January the second 2018)?? We shall see. 

### R1D19
- Still working on Glitch. Trying to figure out how to convert timestamps (unix to natural language and vica versa + null for everything else)

### R1D20
- The project on Glitch is pretty much done. Still want to test it a bit, clean up the code and back it up on GitHub. 

### R1D21
- Finished up Glitch (Timestamp Microservice). Had to figure out how to link css to index.jade, and finally solved it by adding app.use(express.static('public')); to server.js. Also downloaded the files to my computer and then added them to the GitHub repo as per fcc requirements.

### R1D22
- Finished up the second backend assignment: Request Header Parser Microservice. It was actually pretty straightforward, with only one file (server.js). I probably put a good 4 hours into it today. Had a great run!!! :-))
