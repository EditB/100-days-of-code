Log

## R2D1 - 10/04/18
- React

## R2D2 - 11/04/18
- React/Redux

## R2D3 - 12/04/18
- React/Redux

## R2D4 - 13/04/18
- React with TDD (trialling several different environments, setting up testing frameworks, trying to settle on one; after trying to set things up from scratch finally found this link which is really easy to use and it sets everything up: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## R2D5 - 14/04/18
- React TDD - started to write a todo app in React with a TDD approach (following Sanjay Purswani's https://hackernoon.com/a-guide-to-tdd-a-react-redux-todolist-app-part-1-b8a200bb7091)

## R2D6 - 15/4/18
- Still following the react tdd tutorial and keep creating tests before adding elements/code to fulfill the tests. 

## R2D7-8 - 16-7/4/18
- React tutorial; also went through some of my older react code to refresh common code patterns.

## R2D9 - 18/4/18
- React - started to create my own tests and solutions, to add an undelete functionality. 

## R2D10 - 19/4/18
- Still working on the undelete functionality for the React project

## R2D11 - 20/4/18
- Still working on the same React project: disabling and enabling buttons depending on the input

## R2D12 - 21/4/18
- Had a Python workshop today.
- Also got the React project mostly working; changed the logic a bit, with the button disabling.
- Set up Android Studio and had a look at how to create a simple app
- Downloaded NetBeans and created a Hello World app in Java

## R2D13 - 22/4/18
- Styled my react todo app.
- Deployed it to heroku

## R2D14 - 23/4/18
- Playing around with Java
- Did some coding quizes (triplebyte and w3schools)

## R2D15 - 24/4/18
- Went back to my old Free Code Camp projects; started a React project called Leaderboard. Originally it's in CodePen, but I started an offline version on my laptop using create-react-app. We'll see how we go.

## R2D16 - 25/4/18
- Was reading up on React and writing out some code I can work with later down the track.

## R2D17 - 26/4/18
- Felt really flat and tired today. So just followed a React tutorial.

## R2D18 - 27/4/18
- Still tired. React tutorial.

## R2D19 - 28/4/18
- SheHacksGames2018: figuring out how to use Construct2; Created a basic version on a 2d platform game called MageCat.

## R2D20 - 29/4/18
- SheHacksGames2018: finished a working version of MageCat (first level; put it on a looop so that player can keep playing). This was my very first game jam and my very first game programming experience.

## R2D21 - 30/4/18
- Started a different (superhero) game along similar principles as the MageCat

## R2D22 - 01/5/18
- Got back to the React (Leaderboard) project

## R2D23 - 02/5/18
- Added the header and the rows (was using a hardcoded array for now to loop through; still need to implement the API)

## R2D24 - 03/5/18
- Implemented the API for the React Leaderboard project (now it's getting the data from a website)

## R2D25 - 04/5/18
- Finished the React Leaderboard project (added the missing sorting functionality). Could still work more on it (like adding a tool tip on the sortable headers), but since it's already fulfilled all the user stories, will just leave it for now.

## R2D26-30 - 05-09/5/18
- Time flies by so fast. I've been busy working on my web portfolio (a wordpress site); based on some feedback (thank you Andrea!), renamed the sections and also did some custom css for the post-it-note look. Found "stray" projects that I linked up. And also implemented the sortable headers and the tooltip for the Leaderboard project. 

## R2D31-32 - 10-11/5/18
- I was sick but still tried to stick with my portfolio. Just small changes. ALso linked up some articles/posts with my CV.

## R2D33 - 12/5/18
- Fixed up the old TDD-React project (added more styling), and hooked it up with my web portfolio page.

## R2D34 - 13/5/18
- Went back to Ruby on Rails (recipe project)

## R2D35 - 14/5/18
- Deployed an AWS EC2 website (based on DevOpsGirls bootcamp) and hooked it up to my web portfolio. Modified the original website a bit.

## R2D36-37 - 15-16/5/18
- Sass Mixins (based on free code camp beta version)

## R2D38-41 - 17-20/5/18
- Working on React Recipe Box (Free Code Camp project on CodePen; finally managed to write most of it, althogh the remove button is not yet working, and will need to add an Edit button as well.)

## R2D42-66 - 21/5-14/6/18
- Did some more work on Recipe Box (on CodePen - hence no saves in here); also spent a good 5 days on a coding challenge (React.js) and started another one using Node.js
- Also did some work on Free Code Camp (doing mainly React coursework)

## R2D67-99 15/6-15/7/18
- Node.js: figuring out how to make command line tools
- Then we went through hard time with the new neighbours and it wasn't good news for coding either.
- Also had interviews and had to prepare for it. React.js mainly
- Did some SQL practice for SheLovesData
- Spent the first week of July catching up with FreeCodeCamp (did the new front end tutorials, like responsive web design and css grid)
- The second week of July (still going) has been AWS. Getting ready for exams.
- The proper log is in Twitter, that's why I didn't do the day-to-day rundown.

## R2D100 - 16/7/18
- Did 3 lots of AWS practice tests (Cloud Practitioner). Finally passing them consistently over 80+%. Should be good enough to take the real one soon.
- Oh, and finished the second round of 100 days of code! It was much harder this time than the first round. Need a bit of rest.
